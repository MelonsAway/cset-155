    Lab 05: Table Design
  </h1>

  <hr>

  <p>
    We've learned a lot of SQL, but now we're going to put it all together and design a whole database of tables. The goal is to create a set of well-functioning related tables that could be used to store information for a full-fledged program, game, or web application.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do that, we'll use an existing program as inspiration. Pick a program/game/web app that uses a handful of related entities that would each track their own information. For example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The school Portal tracks Users, Courses, Assignments, Grades, Events, etc.</li>
    <li>The game PokemonGo tracks Trainers, Pokemon, Items, Gyms, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can easily see relationships between these entities and easily see attributes of data that would be stored for each record. Modeling a database for both would be a good exercise in Table Design, but we've used these examples before so come up with your own!
  </p>

  <h2>
    Requirements
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Make a single file named <code>last_first_design.sql</code>. This is the only file you'll hand in.</li>
    <li>At the top, write your name, date, and a small description of the program/game/web app you're replicating using SQL comments. See the code we've been using in the lectures for help with the syntax.</li>
    <li>Write <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements for all of your entities using appropriate data types and constraints.</li>
    <li>Make sure each table has a Primary Key.</li>
    <li>Make sure each relationship has a Foreign Key column in one of the tables. To continue with the Portal example, the Assignments table should have a <code>student_id</code> column which references a record in the Students table.</li>
    <li>Make sure each table and column follow appropriate naming conventions.</li>
    <li>Then write <code>INSERT INTO</code> statements to fill your tables with some data. Each table should have enough records to accurately represent the possible data.</li>
    <li>Make sure each <code>INSERT</code> will conform to all the constraints.</li>
    <li>Make sure each relationship is represented within the data.</li>
    <li><strong>And finally, you should write a comment before each query explaining everything that it's doing and why it's doing it. Be thorough.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To grade your lab, I'm going to create a new database and then run your queries to make the tables and insert the data. There shouldn't be a single error. If you've designed your table well, I'll be able to tell at a glance what data it contains and how entities relate to each other.

  <h2>
    Things to Think About
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>There are no minimum requirements since each database will be different. I will grade based on <strong>effort</strong>, as usual, and on relevant application. A database with too many tables is just as <em>wrong</em> as one with too few.</li>
    <li>Spend more time thinking than coding. Design is a solution to a problem, so spend time thinking about the problem.</li>
    <li>Like most programming we've done so far, order matters in SQL. You can't insert data into a table that doesn't exist yet. Make sure your sequence of queries is correct.</li>
    <li>Do not miss potential relationships between your tables. And don't add any that don't need to exist.</li>
    <li>If you screw up some queries, don't forget about the <code>DROP TABLE</code> statement to start over. It might take a few attempts to get everything right.</li>
  </ul>
